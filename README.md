🖥️ C Programming Exercises & Projects

Completed by Sukriti Thakur

A repository containing all C programming exercises, assignments, and projects from my programming class. This collection demonstrates the concepts taught, from basics to advanced topics, and includes tested, well-commented programs.

📚 Overview

This repository contains exercises covering a wide range of C programming topics:

Basics: syntax, variables, data types, and operators

Control flow: loops, conditionals, and switch-case

Functions, recursion, and modular programming

Arrays, strings, and pointers

Structs and file handling

Dynamic memory allocation

Sorting, searching, and matrix operations

Practice exercises, mini-projects, and small applications

Every program is personally completed, tested, and documented for clarity.

✅ Key Learning Outcomes

By completing these exercises, you will be able to:

Write, compile, and debug C programs efficiently

Apply control structures, loops, and functions effectively

Understand and manage memory with pointers and dynamic allocation

Handle files, structures, and arrays for data storage and processing

Build modular programs for larger applications

Implement basic algorithms: sorting, searching, and matrix operations

Develop small practical projects using C

💻 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SukritiTkr/c-programs.git
cd c-programs


Compile and run any C file using GCC:

gcc filename.c -o output
./output


Explore folders according to topics to practice or review exercises.

📄 Notes

All exercises were completed as part of my first-year coursework.

Each file contains comments explaining the logic and steps.

This repository is for learning, practice, and reference purposes.

Programs are updated to follow safe coding practices (avoiding gets(), using fgets() etc.).
