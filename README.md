# 🖥️ C Programming Exercises & Projects

**Completed by Sukriti Thakur**

> A repository containing all C programming exercises, assignments, and projects from my programming class. This is going to be a hands on collection demonstrating the concepts taught, from basics to more advanced topics.

---

## 📚 Overview

This repo covers all topics taught in my programming class, including:

* Basics of C syntax, variables, and data types
* Operators and expressions
* Control flow: loops, conditionals, and switch-case
* Functions, recursion, and modular programming
* Arrays, strings, and pointers
* Structs and file handling
* Dynamic memory allocation
* Practice exercises and mini-projects

Every exercise will be completed personally, tested and commented for clarity.
